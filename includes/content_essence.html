These contemporary images were brushed
with sumi ink by Miyu&nbsp;Tamamura and hand painted with French dyes and mixed media on silk and paper by Sybil. They express the rich and joyful color and the amazing power of the ever-changing seasons of life. Join us in celebrating the Essence of the Seasons.
