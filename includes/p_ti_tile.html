Decorative Tiles
</h1>
<p>
These decorative tiles are created from Italian clay and hand-glazed in a combination of brilliant and satin colors, using old-world craftsman techniques. They are approximately 6"&nbsp;x&nbsp;6" square, and are felt-backed for use as a trivet.  They also have a sturdy non-scratching hang-tag on the back for use as  a wall hanging. Can be hung nicely in a series of two, three, or four together.
