This repo contains the code for the first site I developed on my own, 
about 2004, using custom file-based, not database-backed, PHP scripts. 
The most noteworthy of these is gallery.php, which provides all the site's 
gallery pages, including the main gallery, each series' gallery, and each 
individual image's page. 

I developed this on dreamhost, follwing a friend's referral link, and chose 
a file-based implementation, after reading that dreamhost's database servers 
were not very reliable, as well as for simplicity's sake, for a small site 
updated only occasionally. 

We later added a Zen Cart install, for online sales.
