<p>
The art by Sybil Shane Studio was born out of a life-changing experience for Sybil. She was able to be by her mother&rsquo;s side during her mother&rsquo;s last days of battling cancer. Sybil realized after that intimate experience, that she needed to do what was most important to her at that point in her life. She sold her home, transferred her tax practice, and took some time off for herself and to be with her son. She began to experiment with Japanese papers, collage, and origami. You could say that Sybil found her path again by following this dream.</p><p>So Sybil decided to make the transition, and in 1992 she visited Japan. She fell in love with Japanese design, and the use of negative space. She took classes in art, silk painting, and calligraphy. Since&nbsp;1994, Sybil painted in her studio in Grass Valley; a small town in the foothills of northern California.</p><p>While at a meditation retreat, Sybil and her long-time friend, Tara Sullivan, realized thatthey wanted to collaborate in creating art. Tara is an award-winning designer and illustrator. At age five, Tara was awed by the golden Buddha in a darkened room at the Nelson Art Gallery in Kansas while taking her very first art class. She has drawn ever since. Tara&rsquo;s studio is in Portland, Oregon, where she teaches and designs.</p><p>A native of Kyoto, Japan, Miyu Tamamura graduated from the Kyoto University of Art and studied Sho (traditional Japanese calligraphy) for several years. Miyu and Sybil collaged their art together to create dynamic dancing brush strokes and rich silk textures. Miyu lives and creates art in the same foothill community of northern California.</p><p><img src="SybilPhotoByPat2.jpg" style="float: right; margin:0 0 1em 1em">In early 2010, Sybil transferred her business to Madfrog Galleries. Those who knew her well understood her decision, as she had become ill some years earlier. Her illness was not something that Sybil talked about openly; she wanted neither sympathy nor attention. On January&nbsp;9th, 2012, we lost our beautiful Sybil Shane to cancer. She left this earth peacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones.
</p>
<p>May her art continue to inspire us to find our own inner peace...</p>
